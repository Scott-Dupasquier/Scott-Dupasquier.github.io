            <h2>Work Experience</h2>

            <p>
                I worked as a research assistant in the summer of 2019 with Dr. Ryan
                Hayward attempting to solve the game "Hex" on a 10x10 board
            </p>

            <p>
                I worked for Dr. Yvonne Wong designing a new system to be used by kids
                ages 4-6 who have ADHD, ADD, Autism, or any other similar disorder.
                This included a mobile game that connects with a Muse headset, as well 
                as an online dashboard that stores brainwave information and allows
                game parameters to be changed. The purpose of the app is to provide
                an affordable solution to the expensive treatments that often come along
                with ADHD, Autism, etc.

            <p>
                I am president of East Campus Dodgeball League at the University of Alberta.
                We organize games, tournaments, and other events for our community of over
                200 members.

            <p>
                I've volunteered with Mossom Creek Hatchery since 2012, where we raised
                Pink, Coho, and Chum salmon from eggs. I helped feed the fish, clean the
                tanks, remove invasive plant species, and many other things.
