            <h2>Who am I?</h2>

            <p>
                My name is Scott Dupasquier, I grew up around Vancouver, BC and am 
                enrolled at the University of Alberta. I'm 22 years old and am constantly
                learning new things!
            </p>

            <p>
                I started programming in grade 11, and became enamoured with the field
                instantly. I love the problem solving aspect of computing, and there's
                nothing more gratifying to me than creating software that will be used
                by many people.
            </p>

            <p>
                I also have many interests outside of programming as well! My absolute
                favourite sport is snowboarding, but I also love to play hockey, baseball,
                and golf. I'm also an avid hiker and kayaker, as I find nature simply
                incredible to be in and around.
            </p>

            <h4>Fun Fact</h4>

            <p class="funFact">
                Eight trillion tonnes of water evaporates from the Amazon annually. That's
                nearly 22 billion tonnes in a single day!
