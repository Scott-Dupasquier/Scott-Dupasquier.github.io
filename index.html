        <h2 class="adjust"><a name="about"></a>Who am I?</h2>

        <p class="adjust">
            My name is Scott Dupasquier, I grew up around Vancouver, BC and am 
            enrolled at the University of Alberta. I'm 22 years old and am constantly
            learning new things! If I were to pick a discipline other than computing,
            it would be Earth Sciences since I've always had a passion for understanding
            how the world works.
        </p>

        <h2 class="adjust"><a name="history"></a>Professional History</h2>

        <p class="adjust">
            I worked as a research assistant in the summer of 2019 with Dr. Ryan
            Hayward attempting to solve the game "Hex" on a 10x10 board
        </p>
        <p class="adjust">
            I worked for Dr. Yvonne Wong designing a new system to be used by kids
            ages 4-6 who have ADHD, ADD, Autism, or any other similar disorder.
            This included a mobile game that connects with a Muse headset, as well 
            as an online dashboard that stores brainwave information and allows
            game parameters to be changed. The purpose of the app is to provide
            an affordable solution to the expensive treatments that often come along
            with ADHD, Autism, etc.  
        </p>

        <h2 class="adjust"><a name="offer"></a>What do I Offer?</h2>

        <p class="adjust">
            I have lots of experience with many different languages. I'm strongest
            with object-oriented languages, having worked with Python, C++, C#, and Java.
            I've also worked with C, SQL, SPARQL, and a couple others to a smaller extent.
            I have experience with Git/Github and Unity, and am currently learning HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript.
