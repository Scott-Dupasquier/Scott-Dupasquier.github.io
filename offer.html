            <h3>What do I Offer?</h3>

            <p>
                I have lots of experience with many different languages. I'm strongest
                with object-oriented languages, but also know various procedural, web,
                and database languages.
            </p>

            <h4>Object Oriented and Procedural Languages</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>C</li>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>C# (+Unity)</li>
                <li>Java</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Web Languages</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML</li>
                <li>CSS</li>
                <li>JavaScript</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Database Languages</h4>
            <p>
                Most of my work has dealt with the above programming languages,
                however I do have experience with various database languages as well
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>SQL</li>
                <li>SPARQL</li>
                <li>XML</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Extra</h4>
            <p>
                I also have experience with Git/GitHub, Linux, and am familiar with many different
                software practices such as Agile. I have also worked with MATLAB and MIPS,
                though not very extensively.
            </p>
            <br>

            <h3>Skills</h3>
            <h4>Teamwork</h4>
            <p>
                I've made various apps, websites, and other software while working with a group of people.
                This process has improved my ability to compromise my ideas with those of others, as well
                as teach me effective ways of communication amongst a group. I also played hockey and
                baseball on a team growing up, which taught me the importance of success as a team
                instead of as an individual.
            </p>

            <h4>Organization</h4>
            <p>
                University has taught me the importance of organization, especially in the later years.
                Keeping files and directories clean and easy to understand is super important in big
                projects, and is something I've learnt to excel in doing.
            </p>

            <h4>Work Ethic</h4>
            <p>
                Through my University career I had to balance 4-5 courses per semester while
                maintaining high quality work. When I worked in a restaurant I also needed
                to make elegant food in a timely manner to keep up with the needs of the busy
                restaurant.
